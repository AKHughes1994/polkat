### What is this?

This is a modifed version of the semi-automated routine [oxkat](https://github.com/IanHeywood/oxkat), that has been designed to make polarization calibration as hands-off as possible. I direct the reader to the original oxkat documentation for a more detailed description of the pipeline. Here I will highlight some key differences.

##### Overarching Changes

* This uses a mix of containers, namely `oxkat-0.41.sif` and `polkat-0.0.1.sif`. The latter is only on the idia cluster, and, as a result, if you want to use polkat on other clusters (or locally) you have to download the container and put it in the appropriate directories.

* There are a lot of similarites between the two containers, however, `polkat-0.0.1.sif` now uses [`casa`](https://casa.nrao.edu/) version 6.x. and I have the intention of (eventually) changing all of the [`cubical`](https://github.com/ratt-ru/CubiCal) scripts into [`quartical`](https://github.com/ratt-ru/CubiCal) script.

##### Major changes with respect to oxkat

* The ms file is averaged to 1024 channels in the INFO step (oxkat does this in 1GC. The reason for this has to do with getting the numeric indexes of the (sub-)fields that are used in each calibration run. INFO also identifies the polarization calibator automatically. Currently, MeerKAT defaults to specifying the scan intent as "UNKNOWN" for the polarization calibrator.

* 1GC is the biggest change to the calibration routine. The calibration is based off the attached flow-chart from Ben Hugo, here are the major changes:
  1. We are now solving for additional leakage (Df) terms using the (unpolarized) primary calibrator, Cross-hand delay (KCROSS) terms using the polarization calibrator, and Cross-hand phase (Xf) terms using the polarization calibrator.
  2. The Stokes I models for the secondary calibrator, and the polarization calibrator are solved for using interative imaging and self-calibration (Step name is `RECAL` and uses the `1GC_casa_refinement.py` script).
  3. Ampltiude solutions are transferred from the primary calibrator (not the secondary), any temporal evolution is mapped onto the source through an additional gaintype "T" calibration table that solves for a single temporal evoltion for both the X and Y. This is to avoid transfering polarized signal from the (polarized) seconday onto the source due to differences betweenteen the X and Y gain solutions from the secondary. 
  4. The calibration routine is now broken into three steps: (mostly) parallel-hand XX,YY with `1GC_casa_refcal.py`, secondary/polarization model refinemnet with `1GC_casa_refinement.py`, and (mostly) cross-hand with `1GC_casa_polcal.py`
  5. At the end of 1GC, by defualt, you will image the seconday in Stokes IQUV. You can use this to check the calibration against the [cataloged values](https://skaafrica.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESDKB/pages/1452146701/L-band+gain+calibrators)
 
 * FLAG and 2GC have been combined into a single step (at some point I'll break them up again) the major differences:
  1. is now the "datamask" and "pcalmask" images are full stokes IQUV.
  2. The routine no longer splits out the calibrated source(s) into separate ms file(s). The reason is that, for linear feeds, the parallactic angle corrections due not commute. More simply, What this means is that if you perform full polarization calibration (with parallactic angle corrections) and then split out the data for self-calibrating, you will "over-correcting" the parallactic angle. Further gain solutions will be incorrect as you are now solving for the values against the rotated visibilities. 
  3. As a result of 2. the routine is now doing self-calibration using `casa` rather than `cubical`. I haven't been able to figure out (and it may not be possible) how to feed casa tables into cubical.


# VERY IMPORTANT: CHECK YOUR VISIBILITES + GAIN TABLES BEFORE MOVING ON FROM 1GC to FLAG, POLARIZATION CALIBRATION CAN DO WEIRD THINGS!

##### Example run

In it's current state, polkat should work as a "plug-and-chug" routine, an example run would be:

Download and copy polkat into a working directory (edit the PRE_FIELDS parameter in the oxkat/config.py file to select a subset of fields; i.e., primary, secondary, pol. cal., source)
```
cp polkat working_directory/.
```
Create a symbolic link pointing to the ms file of interest
```
cd working_directory
ln -s /idia/raw/xkat/SCI-20230907-RF-01/1700301738/1700301738_sdp_l0.ms .
```
Run INFO
```
python3 setups/0_GET_INFO.py idia
./submit_info_jobs.sh
```
Repeat above step for 1GC.py and FLAG.py, and your final data products will be produced.

##### To Do List

1. Add ionospheric corrections. The ionosphere can have RM values up to ~ 5 rad/m^2 which corresponds to ~30 degrees at the bottom of L-band. Do not use polkat for UHF until we figure out the ionospheric corrections.
2. Investigate full self calibration polarisation routines.
